I was surprised by the issues we found. They felt like privileged Mexico City annoyances, rather than major problems faced by our global audience. But after some thinking, it became clearer that users expected the experience to just work with minimal effort.

# HoverCAD/AI

> Intro
> Machine Assisted 3D Reconstruction Web SPA
> Blank sheet design to replace the debt-laden, inefficient, implementation-centric tools that powered Hover's core product.

> HoverCAD Decision Machine
> Our attempt to find Tesler's Law in HoverCAD. Each element in our product had a series of states, and by writing each one out we became aware of weight on user's working memory. We included prerequisites for each state, and post-effects on any other element in the system. Creating UX-flows for every possible combination of states in an open tool like this just isn't possible, this was the tool we built to do that job.

HoverCAD
A blank-sheet 3D modeling web app, built to integrate AI tools as they were developed by our automation team. We cut Hover's unit cost in half within the first year. Then we did it again in year two. Core features include interactive photogrammetry for solving camera networks, CV-powered surface texturing & ML-powered feature recognition. We also made UX gains with a suite of parametric-bounded modeling tools.

Machine assists like interactive photogrammetry for solving camera networks, CV surface texturing & ML-powered feature recognition. We also made UX gains with a suite of parametric-bounded modeling tools. The result: a 75% drop in Hover's unit cost by year two.





# Design System

> Architecture
> Web components built in react/redux, 3D in paper.js.

After showing wild increases in velocity developing features on top of this system, it was spread company-wide.




# ARCap

> Intro
> CV-Assisted Property Capture App - Mobile

1st time failures were common. Not an issue for professionals, especially when the tool was rolled out to an org with training and sales support.

For homeowners, however, a first time failure is a permanent failure. They only capture their home once, it's essentially part of the onboarding flow, so attrition here was a self-inflicted wound.

I was in charge of our reconstruction tools, so I was also brought into the homeowner facing app to make sure we collected the data needed to model the home well.

Several pronged: guided capture using new CV capabilities on-device, fast failures with remedy steps as a final attempt to save the relationship, although at that point the trust in our tech would be broken for most users.

# Design Studio

> Intro
3D Home Design Configurator - Tablet/Web
Responsible for expanding a mobile formatted prototype to tablet/web. Also asked to draw icon set, including main navbar, architectural features like window sash configurations

> Iconography, UI refresh, dark mode
Icons tested with card sorting method - test with context as a set, meanings are relative. Card sorting because icons are association, not messaging. Not the place to explain what an app does, simple, distinct gestalt for each icon within a set is more important than familiarity (with some real world object)

# Company Culture

> DataViz as Performance Review
> Hover's career leveling spreadsheet is encyclopedic, and asking for a promotion meant verbally pitching yourself against dozens of soft and hard skills all at once. Instead, I turned my perf review into dataviz. The image <a href="https://unfussy.org/media/LevelingViz.pdf" target="_blank" class="rule">speaks for itself</a>. After good feedback from design management, I open-sourced the format.<br />
